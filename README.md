## Description

This project was to take existing code for the Horiseon webpage and refactor it. Horiseon is a marketing agency wanted to make their existing site more accessible while at the same time enhancing the site for branding. This optimization will also ensure that the webpage is optimized for search engines.

```md
The goal for the webpage is to meet accessibility standards. The source code should:
1. Consist of semantic HTML elements
2. Include elements which follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
3. Contain image tags with accessible alt attributes
4. Ensure heading attributes fall in sequential order
5. Have a concise, descriptive title
```
